        <h1 class="mt-5" style="text-align: center;"><strong>Why I Share My Story</strong></h1>
        <h4 class="mt-5"  style="text-align: center;"> Written by: Dr. Meg Colley</h4>
      
    
    <div class="content" style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;">
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-4"><img src="why.jpg" alt="" width="90%"></div>
        <div class="col-md-7"><p class="mt-4" style="word-spacing: 10px;">My choice to share my story, my personal experiences, was not made lightly. At first, I couldn’t even imagine being open about my past, about the things I have always kept private. Sharing my secrets to the world is still terrifying. But then I started looking into the unbelievably high rates of sexual assault, rates that aren’t changing. I think about how the men who assaulted me will never get justice during this lifetime, about how they are still out there contuing to exploit women.</p></div>
      </div>
      <p class="mt-4">Then I look at my daughters. There is nothing I can do to change my history, but perhaps there is something I can do to change their future. Perhaps sharing my story will open people’s eyes to how trauma can affect entire families for decades. Perhaps people will realize how few treatment options there are for the millions of women who have already been sexually assaulted. Perhaps people will realize that even the treatment programs that are available can be as harmful as they are helpful. Perhaps my story will inspire people to act, to create change.</p>
      
      <p class="mt-4">I want people to do something about the violence happening toward women. It’s not changing. People say they care but nothing changes. <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/642458/rape-and-sexual-assault-victims-in-the-us-by-gender/">The sexual assault rates in the US have not improved for twenty years</a>. Twenty years and no change! If anything, it’s worse. We are obviously not doing enough. Women should not be getting raped at all, let alone half a million women a year. Every 73 seconds an American is sexually assaulted. By the time you finish reading this narrative, another 5 women have been raped. It is estimated <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/featuredtopics/sexual-violence.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Finjury%2Ffeatures%2Fsexual-violence%2Findex.html">1 in 3 women will face sexual violence in their lifetime</a>. The current rates are disgusting. And we are underreporting; it’s hard to speak up. So the true rates are likely much higher. These statistics are embarrassing for our country. We have become complacent with our daughters. Wives. Sisters. Mothers. Being assaulted. In the US. In every subculture. How do you feel about sending your daughters out into a world where they have a 30% chance of being sexually assaulted? It sure doesn’t make me feel good.</p>
      <p class="mt-4">I also want to bring to light the conditions that chronic pain patients have to cope with. Researchers should consider chronic pain patients as a special population. We are desparate beyond measure to be be better and get our lives back. We will do almost anything to do that. We want to escape the torture of constant, unrelenting pain. That means we will stay in a program that is unethical because it is the only way we think we can get better. It’s what we are told. The fear is not that the program is treating us wrongly, it is that we will be kicked out. The power of this desparation is incredible. But chronic pain patients aren’t considered a special population. Ethics committees need to consider the desparate state of patients with chronic illness when approving studies. I went to two of the best programs in the nation and both times I was re-traumatized. And it could have been avoided. These are the best there is to offer? To help the tens of millions of American women who have been harmed by our fathers, brothers, sons, friends, husbands?</p>
      <p class="mt-4" style="font-style: oblique;">The rates of sexual assault, of violence towards women, of mental illness, they represent a major crisis in the United States. The lack of treatment options and providers is part of this crisis, because we don’t have enough therapists to treat the number of Americans who have mental illness. We admit to having a substance use crisis because it’s easier to blame. But under the substance use is almost always a trauma or mental illness. Not enough is being done to prevent it or treat the survivors. This is a mental health crisis. This is a women’s right’s crisis. It’s a disease deeply rooted in our society and we need to dig it out.</p>
      <p class="mt-4">But what are we supposed to do? Change college drinking culture, perhaps? No. First, the high rate of sexual assault is not only happening to college women or perpetrated by drunk men. Blaming college drinking culture completely ignores the real culprit and blames the victim. The real culprits are the rapists, and they are often not the ones drinking. It is their fault only. Not the person who threw a party or who went to a party or who got excited to get smashed. Not the person who dressed too sexy, who flirted too much, who gave the wrong signals. It is the fault of the person who chose to assault another person. Their fault only. And almost all perpetrators are men, with most victims being women (9 in 10). This is a gender issue deeply rooted in our culture. This is a violence issue. This is a systemic issue.</p>
      <p class="mt-4">I want people to know this is happening to your kids, your siblings, your spouses, your parents, and you just dont know it. My family never would have imagined it would happen. I sure didn’t.</p>
      <p class="mt-4"><strong>You can no longer look the other way because it’s happening eveywhere.</strong> </p>
      <p class="mt-4">But what do we do? What can we do? The first step is to open our eyes. This means that women, we have to speak up, and when we do, men, you need to take it seriously.  DO something. Fight for us. Do not allow other men to prey upon us. Men, right now you have the power, use it to do good. Because nothing is changing. And why should we bother saying anything when nothing changes. I hope sharing my story will help open eyes. I hope sharing it will give me a platform to fight for my sisters, my cousins, my daughters, to make sure it finally stops.</p>
