          <h2 class="mt-4" style="text-align: center;">Who is this Dr. Meg fellow you’ve heard about?</h2>
            <p class="mt-4">
              As I considered how I might write my “about me” page, I knew I wanted it to be fun. I’ve spent too much time skimming boring articles of the resume-in-paragraph-form variety. I wanted to use a different way of summarizing a person…🤔…perhaps in a style I’ve had plenty of practice? Yes! That’s it! A Psychological Evaluation! 😆😀 <br>(The following is an ‘About Me’ article in a format commonly used by psychologists to write psychological evaluations. It was written out of fun and should not be considered a true medical document or any form of valid evaluation) </p>
              <p class = "mt-4"> I hope you’ll enjoy getting to know me. Comment to ask questions and let me know what you think!</p>

  <p class="mt-4">Client Name:  Meghan (Kelly) Colley</p>
  
  <p class="mt-4">Client Age: 36 years old</p>
  
  <p class="mt-4">Date of Report: June 12th, 2022</p>
  
  <p class="mt-4">Dates of Assesesment:  May 27, 2022</p>
  
  <p class="mt-4">Instruments/Methods Used: Goal-Directed Introspection (Self Interview), Values Card Sort, Myers-Briggs Inventory, VIA Survey of Character Strengths</p>
  
  <p class="mt-4">Evaluator: Meghan Colley, PsyD, HSPP</p>

        </div>
  <h2 class="mt-4">Reason for Referral</h2>
  <p class="mt-4">Dr. Meg was referred for evaluation by herself. Dr. Meg reported that she wants to make her ‘About Me’ blog article “not boring”. She stated that she wants people to be entertained while they learn about her and “not be bored by reading a resume in sentence format.” The following evaluation of Dr. Meg consists of three segments: (1)  biopsychosocial history,  (2) psychological assessment results and (3) Summary and recommendations. </p>
  
  <h2 class="mt-4">Biopsychosocial History</h2>
  <h4 class = "mt-4">Family HistoryAcademic/Professional History</h4>
  <p class="mt-4">
    Dr. Meg is a 36-year-old woman of European ancestry. She reports “mostly Irish,” British, and German heritage. She also claims to be a descendent of the historically famous John Chapman, more commonly known as “Johnny Appleseed.”</p>
    <p class="mt-4">
      Dr. Meg said she was born and raised in “The Fort”, in reference to the city of Fort Wayne, Indiana. She reported having a “good” and “normal” childhood. She is the oldest child of three, with two younger siblings, a sister (age 34) and a brother (age 30). She said her parents have been married “for like 35 years”, reporting her father as an artist and small business owner and her mother as a retired small business owner and avid reader. Dr. Meg  reported that her parents are her main support system. She appeared very grateful for their support while sharing this information.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-4"> 
Dr. Meg has has two daughters, age 6 and 7 at the time of this evaluation.  When asked to describe her kids, she said “I have two happy talented loving intelligent healthy gorgeous daughters. I couldn’t be more grateful to have such amazing kids.”
    </p>
  <h4 class="mt-4">Academic History</h4>

  <p class="mt-4">Dr. Meg reported that she had a “stellar academic career” and “was really good at learning so (she) just kept going.” She graduated from Homestead High School in 2004 to attend the University of Indianapolis (UIndy) after being awarded the “Presential Scholar” full tuition scholarship. In 2008, She graduated from UIndy with her Bachelor of Arts degree, majoring in psychology and minoring in studio art. Upon graduation, she was awarded the Martin Award for Psychology and the Lynd. L. Esch Scholar Award for Acamedic Excellence.  At this point during the interview, Dr. Meg appeared both embarrassed and proud, alternating between smiling and grimacing, as she said “I used to be quite the perfectionist and maybe a bit of an over-achiever, so I graduated with my Bachelor of Arts with a 4.0 GPA, the college version of valedictorian, you could say.”</p>

  <p class="mt-4">Dr. Meg also earned her Master of Arts in 2010 and graduated with her Doctorate of Psychology, with a Child and Adolescent Development Concentration in 2013 at the University of Indianapolis. She spoke of being awarded a Graduate Assistantship (GA) when accepted into the doctoral program. When asked what that meant, she said “it paid for a big chunk of tuition in exchange for helping professors with teaching and research, like a combo teaching assistant/research assistant”. Dr. Meg said she “helped a lot” with the University based Psychological Services Center, course development, and research. She reported feeling nostalgic when remembering her work as a part of the “Avengers” research team (See Appendix A for a list of Dr. Meg’s research). She said her own research and dissertation was in the area of parenting and positive psychology, titled “Synchrony in Parent-Child Interactions: Socioemotional and Cognitive Competencies in School Age Children” [insert link]</p>
  <p class="mt-4">Dr. Meg graduated with her PsyD after completing her pre-doctoral internship with Astor Services, which was located in Rhinebeck,NY, just north of New York City. During the interview, Dr. Meg insisted on also stating “for those who don’t know, the psychologist internship is like the medical residencies that physicians complete”  She stated the internship was an incredible learning experience and a “Grade A site”, especially under internship director/supervisor Dr. Athena Drewes [insert link], founder and president of the New York Play Therapy Association and author of “bunches of books.” Dr. Meg said “I am super glad that I got placed at Astor. My supervisors–the psychologists who trained me–were top notch and I learned so much there, I can’t even.”</p>
  <p class="mt-4">Dr. Meg said that after she completed graduation, she returned to her hometown, Fort Wayne, because she was pregnant with her first child and “wanted the baby to be raised around family.” She then leaned in, put her hand up to her mouth as if to tell a secret, and whispered “free babysitters” while dramatically moving her eyebrows up and down and grinning.</p>
  <p class="mt-4">Dr. Meg completed two post-doctoral fellowships, one in private practice and then in community mental health, and earned her full licensure as a Health Service Provider in Psychology in 2015. She continued work at the community mental health center up until she retired in 2019 due to physical disability.</p>
  <p class="mt-4">She says that since she has “retired.” She has devoted her extra time to social media. She said “I started twitter as a way to keep my pinkie toe in the field, and now I have a decent following, so I guess I’m going to try to truly be an influencer. Although the idea that I might have fans still feels super weird.” She said she is excited to have a platform from which to advocate, teach, and discuss mental health related topics. She said that her future plans include being an advocate for mental health and women’s rights. She stated “I will tell my story to whoever will listen, to raise awareness of what is happening right now, to people with mental illness and to women. To give a story to the statistics. And I dream big, so maybe I’ll even get the opportunity to speak directly with congress and our president. If it can make a difference, and I am able to do it, I will,” </p>
  <p class="mt-4">Dr. Meg said she has recently joined Patreon.com [insert link]. She said she calls her patrons her “Shrinksquad” and she runs a private Facebook group, called The Shrinksquad [insert link], that includes professionals across the field of psychology, patients and mental health advocates, and “any person interested in discussing awesome psychology topics.” She also said “anyone can join the Shrinksquad, even you! If youre interested visit patreon”</p>

  <h4 class="mt-4">Hobbies/Talents</h4>
  
  <p class="mt-4">When asked about extracurricular activities and hobbies, she said played co-ed intramural volleyball, was a member of “some clubs,” and “did a lot of volunteering” in college. She said she “used to kick ass in the underground campus ping-pong circuit.” Dr. Meg said her current hobbies are crafting with her kids, playing piano, reading science fiction and fantasy novels, and playing strategy games.</p>
  <p class="mt-4">When asked about her history of volunteer work, she said “it had a huge impact on me, gave me insight into myself and convinced me I wanted a career helping people, kids in particular.”</p>
  <p class="mt-4">She stated her volunteer work included: starting a student organization called UIndy Promotion for Animal Welfare and Safety (PAWS) that was partnered with Indianapolis Animal Care and Control; teaching after school art classes for underprivileged/high-need kids involved with Big Brother/Big Sister; and being a College Mentors for Kids! mentor for an ESL school. She said most of her service work was in her community on the south side of Indianapolis, however she also did a service internship in rural Ciudad Quesada, Costa Rica, where she developed and implemented a self esteem workshop for elementary age kids.</p>
  <p class="mt-4">She said these experiences not only inspired her career, but also helped her “gain perspective” She said it was at this point in her life when “I decided I would use my gifts and privilege, the advantages I had growing up that others didn’t, to try to help people, so more people could have the same opportunities I had.”

  </p>
  <p class="mt-4">Dr. Meg reported that she plays piano, and has a “weekly standing gig” playing live at a downtown bar called Club Soda. She said she had lessons from age 8 to 18, where she was taught to read and play classical piano. She also stated that she enjoys “jammin’ on the fly” and playing “12 Bar Blues.” She said she has recently starting doing some performances on Facebook Live [insert link]</p>
  <p class="mt-4">Dr. Meg continued on to say that she’s also a “closet artist.” She said that she was gifted with a talent for art and has been “really good” for as long as she can remember. She said she comes from a family of artists, her mom majored in art and her uncle Matt Kelly and her dad Tom Kelly are “probably well-known among the local art community” She said she was raised in the local art community, and would often go to art museums or paintspoke of her “third set of grandparents, Sue and George McCollough</p>

  <h2 class="mt-4">Reason for Referral</h2>
  
  <h4 class="mt-4">Psychological Assessment Results</h4>

  <p class="mt-4"><strong>Medical History</strong></p>
  <p class="mt-4">Dr. Meg reported a substantial medical history. She stated she was born with Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (Kyphoscoliosis Type), a genetic disorder that affects connective tissue, the immune system, and the autonomic nervous system. She said that as a result of this genetic problem, she had child onset Kyphoscoliosis, then developed Fibromyalgia, Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, Migraines, Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS), and Dysautonomia. She reported that the symptoms became worse in her 30s, and ultimately resulted in her early “retirement” at age 33 in 2019.  When asked how EDS affects her life currently, she stated “I have to be very careful about how I use my energy. If I’m not, I’ll end up in the hospital with some sort of ‘-itis’, which has happened too many times to count now.”</p>
  <p class="mt-4">Dr. Meg stated that she wants to be open about her medical conditions to raise awareness and funds for further research, as there is currently no cure or treatment for EDS, and the overall outlook for health and lifespan is poor. She asked that people take time to learn more about EDS here and even consider donating to this organization, which is working on finding effecting treatments.
  </p>
  <h2 class="mt-4">
    Mental Health</h2>
  <p class="mt-4">Dr. Meg stated she was diagnosed with Depression at the age of 15, and has continued to battle the disease throughout her adult life. She stated that “at times within the last few years, after I retired, I’ve had several bouts of severe depression and have struggled a lot with suicidal thoughts.” She stated she is better currently and has hopes that she will continue to improve.</p>
  <p class="mt-4">Dr. Meg said that she was diagnosed with PTSD two years ago after she recovered the memory of a repressed trauma. She stated she was sexually assaulted in 2008, but had no memory of the event until after she retired in 2019. She said “I know it’s hard to believe, I even had trouble believing it, but there’s actually so much evidence. I still have a hard time  believing I was able to hide something like that from myself for so long.” She stated that after the assault in 2008 she started having different physical and mental health symptoms that “didn’t make sense until I finally had the information needed, the actual memory, to put the puzzle pieces together.” She said she coped by focusing on work and staying busy, until “my body just couldn’t anymore.”</p>
  <p class="mt-4">Dr. Meg stated she wants to be open about her own mental health diagnoses to raise awareness and normalize mental illness. She said she has been surprised at how many health providers have said they privately struggle with similar issues, and have reached out to tell her how they appreciate her speaking about the importance of addressing and even using one’s own lived experience as a health provider. She said “I think my experiences as a psychologist and patient lead to a unique, comprehensive perspective to understanding mental illness and it’s links to physical health.” She stated that she hopes she can help others understand mental illness better, and through this understanding, reduce stigma.</p>

  <p class="mt-4">When asked about her strengths, Dr. Meg said “my greatest strength is probably my creativity.” She said she is also good at learning, making art and playing piano. She said she has a “standing gig” playing piano at a piano bar called Club Soda in downtown Fort Wayne. She also said “I sometimes do art in my free time– I even used to run an Etsy site. You can see my art on my Instagram under @drmegtheartist”.</p>
  <h2 class="mt-4">Evaluation Results</h2>
  <p class="mt-4">Dr. Meg completed several self-tests as part of her self evaluation.</p>
  <p class="mt-4">Values card sort:</p>
  <p class="mt-4">Dr. Meg completed an online Values Card Sort test. Her top six values were:</p>
  <p class="mt-4">Authenticity, Spirituality, Acceptence, Freedom, Love, and Persistence.</p>
  <p class="mt-4">
    Values In Action Survey of Character Strengths (VIA – Survey of Character Strengths)
  </p>
  <p class="mt-4">Dr. Meg completed the free online assessment available from University of Pennsylvania. Unlike many free online tests, the VIA has some psychometric validity and has been studied often.</p>
  <p class="mt-4">
    Dr. Meg stated that her top character strengths have stayed the same since she first took the test about 10 years ago. Her top five character strengths are:</p>
  <p class="mt-4">Creativity, Capacity to Love and Be Loved, Appreciation of Beauty, Love of Learning, and Genuineness.</p>
  <p class="mt-4">Myers-Briggs Personality Inventory</p>
  <p class="mt-4">Dr. Meg completed the self report objective questionnaire, the Myer-Briggs personality test. While not used clinically, this instrument still remains a common way for people to positively assess personality characteristics and explore personality traits.</p>
  <p class="mt-4">Dr. Meg’s results of the Myers-Briggs assessment place her in the personality type INFP. Dr. Meg’s results show she is slightly introverted and strongly intuitive. According to ….. People who are INFPs are…..</p>
  <h2 class="mt-4">Summary and Goals:</h2>
  <p class="mt-4">Dr. Meg is. 36- year old psychologist retired due to disability. She has significant medical and mental health difficulties that interfere with her ability to work as a traditional psychologist. However, her self report and the results of the assessment show she also has many strengths and skills. She is an intelligent, creative, caring, and genuine woman who values authenticity, love, and helping others.</p>
  <p class="mt-4">She has set the following goals for herself:</p>
  <p class="mt-4">
    1. Dr. Meg wants to be an advocate for those with mental illness. She wants to be a voice to speak up for patient rights and against the stigma towards those with mental illness. She wants to inspire others to take action to increase access and quality of care to those with mental illness.</p>
  <p class="mt-4">
    2. Dr. Meg wants to advocate for women right’s, specifically she wants to raise awareness of the violence millions of American women face every day. She is outraged that she lives in a society that is silent and complacent when it comes to violence towards women, as evidenced by the current rates of sexual assault (1:3) and domestic violence (1:2), which haven’t changed for twenty years. She says she will tell her story to anyone who will listen, if it will inspire them take action to finally stop the violence towards women in the United States. 
    </p>
  <p class="mt-4">3. Dr. Meg said she has been told she is good at teaching enough times she believes it. She said it is rewarding to share her knowledge and make the science of psychology “digestible” for the everyday person. She wants to use her knowledge and experience as a psychologist and patient to teach “regular folk” what the science of psychology tells us and how to apply it to our lives. She does this currently through Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and this very Blog. She is strongly considering making a few series of video “how-to’s” surrounding topics of parenting, kids, positive psychology, and trauma, her reported areas of expertise. Thus far she has created a pilot video about “how to give your kids directions”
  </p>
  <p class="mt-4">4. Dr. Meg writes often. She hopes to someday publish childrens books (so far she’s written four) and her memoir (much of which is already written). She said she’d love to be the illustrator for her children’s books as well.</p>
  <p class="mt-4">5. Dr. Meg plays piano, and she wants to keep doing so. She plays classical pieces, modern compositions, and composes her own songs. She stated thay recently she has been learning how to improvise the blues, and would love to team up other musicians, especially a vocalist “to sing the songs I write.”</p>
