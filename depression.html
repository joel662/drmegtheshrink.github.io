    <p class="mt-4">Depression is a major problem worldwide. If you dont believe me, here are  <a href="https://disturbmenot.co/depression-statistics/">33 Important Depression Statistics to be Aware of in 2021</a>. Once you’ve reviewed that, you might be wondering even more what this depression thing is all about. Why is it so disabling? What does it look like? Truly, how do you know if you’re depressed. Is it moping around? Feeling sad sometimes? Maybe. It depends (as we in “the field” like to say).</p>
    <p class="mt-4">Officially, The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-5) of psychological disorders lists criteria needed for a diagnosis of a depressed episode. Heres a link to the <a href="https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/depression/what-is-depression">American Psychiatric Association</a>’s description of depression.</p>
    <p class="mt-4">Here’s my interpretation of the DSM-5 criteria in layman’s terms:</p>
    <p class="mt-4">You must have at least one of the following:</p>
    <p class="mt-4">(1) Depressed mood most of the time. Also you could be really irritable, feeling like you have a short fuse, everything is annoying or frustrating, and there’s no patience.</p>
    <p class="mt-4">(2) Not enjoying the things you used to love.</p>
    <p class="mt-4">If you are having a major depressive episode, you’ll also be experiencing many of the following:</p>
    <p class="mt-4">(3) Feeling worthless and down on yourself</p>
    <p class="mt-4">(4) Being super tired all the time, sometimes so fatigued it’s like you cant move at all</p>  
    <p class="mt-4">(5) Your brain doesnt seem to work quite right, its hard to think, and dont even think about trying make a decision.</p>  
    <p class="mt-4">(6) Thinking about death. Fantasies about dying. Wishes to be dead. To not exist. Thinking about how to kill yourself.</p>  
    <p class="mt-4">(7) Sleep problems. Either you are sleeping too much, like all the time.  Or you cant sleep at all. You might be exhausted but just cant sleep.</p>  
    <p class="mt-4">(8) Eating is a major problem too. Either you are eating a ton or the idea of eating becomes repulsive and you’re appetite is gone. You’ve likely gained or lost weight.</p>
    <p class="mt-4">All of these make up the diagnostic criteria for a depressive episode. <strong>If you or someone you know has at least 5 of these, they probably have medically significant depression, and should be getting treatment. If they, or you, arent seeing a psychiatrist or therapist, it’s a good idea to at least get checked out by a professional. No one should have to live like this. It can get better. Here’s some <a href="https://www.helpguide.org/articles/suicide-prevention/are-you-feeling-suicidal.htm">help</a> if you need it.</strong> </p>
    <p class="mt-4">To me, depression is the experience of almost drowning. Nonstop. Like you’re treading water but you’ve been doing it for a long time, so long, and it’s just getting so hard to keep your head above water. And all of your energy, the little you have left, has to be devoted to just staying alive.</p>
    <p class="mt-4" style="font-style: italic;">Depression has commonalities but each face of depression is different. Each experience is different. How would you describe depression? How would you word your experiences in a way that might let others know what it’s truly like? What is depression, in your words?</p>
